# 🚀 CloudNative-DevOps-Lifecycle-Automation

Modern cloud-native applications demand reliable infrastructure, secure deployments, and scalable CI/CD workflows. This project eliminates the complexities of manual configuration and operations by fully automating:

Infrastructure provisioning using Terraform

Container orchestration via Kubernetes on AWS EKS

GitOps-based deployment management with Argo CD

CI/CD pipeline automation through GitHub Actions

The result is a production-grade, self-managed microservices platform that follows best practices in GitOps, infrastructure as code (IaC), and secure cloud-native DevOps, with custom domain routing via AWS Route 53 and Kubernetes Ingress
